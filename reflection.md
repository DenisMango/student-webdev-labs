## Reflection Document

### HTML

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I was able to complete these without the videos. However I didn't get it exactly right and I adjusted according to the video. For labs I love to give it a try but when it does not work I like to use the tools that are provided to change my code.\

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
They were helpful to refresh some of my skills. I had used HTML before but was not confident at all and needed some refreshers to really jog my memory. Form was probably the most useful since I do struggle with it a bit when I need to format.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
Personally I wish there was more going over different types of html semantics but I realize that the videos were mostly for that. There wasn't really anything specifically. I also wish we understood how classes worked before css a bit more as I struggled on that bit for the fist day or so.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
I don't know exactly. Like I said above I feel as though maybe going over classes a bit more and how that is in html before css would have been beneficial but in all it seemed that the videos answered most of my questions as I like to have it playing while following along.

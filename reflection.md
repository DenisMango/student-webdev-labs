## Reflection Document

### HTML

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I was able to complete these without the videos. However I didn't get it exactly right and I adjusted according to the video. For labs I love to give it a try but when it does not work I like to use the tools that are provided to change my code.\

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
They were helpful to refresh some of my skills. I had used HTML before but was not confident at all and needed some refreshers to really jog my memory. Form was probably the most useful since I do struggle with it a bit when I need to format.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
Personally I wish there was more going over different types of html semantics but I realize that the videos were mostly for that. There wasn't really anything specifically. I also wish we understood how classes worked before css a bit more as I struggled on that bit for the fist day or so.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
I don't know exactly. Like I said above I feel as though maybe going over classes a bit more and how that is in html before css would have been beneficial but in all it seemed that the videos answered most of my questions as I like to have it playing while following along.

### Accessibility

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I completed it in my way but I also watched the video for help. I found this section pretty easy as I think accessibility is really a more simple thing to add. however I havn't worked on any high level projects that need a lot of lines of code and time.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
I found it more helpful to learn how to look out for certain things in accessibility. It was just one exercise so it was all helpful. In all I think it was a nice way to get introduced or to practice.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
I wish there was maybe just a bit more to do I guess maybe a second exercise but it was explained all good in the videos.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
Maybe more advanced techniques to learn about accessibility as this just seemed a bit easy.

### CSS

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I had help for most of these. I struggle to get the exact parts down to make it look exactly the same so I followed the video after I gave it my best shot to make it look exactly the same. I think when in the real world I will be using maybe different techniques to get it down exactly.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
I found this a 10/10 for helpfulness. I struggled a bit on the assignment but going back and looking at this code helped me a lot to get it done.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
I guess sometimes it felt as though I should be better than I am. I struggle a bit with css still and maybe going a bit slower and explaning would help but other than that these were good.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
I can't think of anything specific but the assignmnets maybe helped a lot and that is what got me to be way better at css.

### FlexBox

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I had trouble a lot as the boxes would not show up and I had no idea what to do so I just followed a long with the video. I was able to fix it after I finished following the video so it did feel like I wasted a bit of the learning part.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
I found them really helpful. Flexbox is what I struggled a bit on one assignment as I could not figure out at all how to use one as it just kept putting it above and below and if only I decided to look back then it might have helped a lot.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
Nothing. I felt like this exercise explains flexbox very good. Having it match like 6 differnt boxes makes it a lot more in depth.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
Maybe a 2nd one like we have with grid but I genuinly don't know what there could be.

### CSS Grid

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I was able to complete most of it on my own but again I used the videos as background noise and to complete the assignment. I looked over a couple grids and got the jist of it. I then corrected based on the videos.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
I found grid to be more helpful as grid areas I guess is more in depth and for when we need to adjust for smaller or bigger screens. But grid showed the basics great.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
Honestly not really. I still don't really get was the fr means exactly but it's not a big deal.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
Maybe different types of grids. I'm not sure exactly as I don't know any more types of grids.

### Bootstrap

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I had a lot of struggles with bootstrap. I did not struggle all that much but getting the specifics was painful. I had to use the videos to get it down mostly. I guess when recreating something exactly I struggle a bit.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
To be honest it just felt like more html I guess after doing css for so long it really just felt like more html and having to get the specifics to match exactly what someone wants.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
I guess how you can just see a picture and recreate it. I feel like that is a skill I don't have and don't really know how to get it completely. I try as much as I can and can get it close but it's hard.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
What would help is what I said above probably just getting the feel for it.

### JavaScript

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I used the videos. I also found out about the solutions which does help a lot as well. Helps me when i following along with the video. Javascript is hard.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
Fetch was useful. APIs are sometimes hard to work with and this helped me a bit as my previous work with apis I had a lot of help from other members with the api portions of projects.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
I think maybe just going over more javascript functions would be nice just things that we will be using a lot compared to other things.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
None that i can think of specifically.

### JQuery

**Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?**
I used the videos mainly to help me with this lab. I think I still have some issues of understanding still.

**How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?**
I found ajax to be more helpful as it just made more sense to me compared to dom as dom just had a small condensed code but ajax made me actually see it more and spread out the code.

**Was there something that you wish had been explained better?**
I think adding more examples always helps. Maybe more use cases.

**Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?**
There is nothing that I can think of that can be added in my opinion.
